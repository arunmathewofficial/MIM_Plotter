Plotting Scripts for the multi-ion Module Method paper

Below are the descriptions of the Python scripts contained in this package: 

### 1. cie_asplund.py
This script plots the ion fraction of collisional ionization equilibrium
as a function of temperature for a given solar elemental abundance 
provided by Asplund et al. (2009).

### 2. cie_eatson.py
This script plots the ion fraction of collisional ionization equilibrium 
as a function of temperature for a given elemental abundance of 
Wolf-Rayet-Carbon, consistent with that reported in Eatson et al. (2022).

### 3. cooling_function.py
This script plots the cooling function for two different elemental 
abundances: solar abundance (Asplund et al. (2009)) and Wolf-Rayet-Carbon 
abundance (Eatson et al. (2022)). It also visualizes the cooling function 
contributions of individual elements as well as the net contribution. 
Furthermore, it provides a comparison of the net cooling functions attributed
to solar abundance, Wolf-Rayet-Carbon abundance, and the original cooling 
data from Asplund et al. (2009).

### 4. adibatic_flow_struc.py
Generate a comparison plot for low and high-resolution chemical profiles in 
the vicinity of the shock for the adiabatic flow.

### 5. adiabatic_ion_profile.py
Generate a comparison plot for low (1024) and high-resolution (10240) chemical profiles in 
the vicinity of the shock.

### 6. non-adiabatic_flow_analysis.py
This script plots flow quantities and ionization profiles for the 
non-adiabatic shock test case. The plots re generated to compare the effects 
of the cooling function on density and the cooling timescale.



# Multi-ion Module MPv10 Testing Scripts #

### 1. test_xsection.py
Plot the comparison between the photoionization cross-section generated by PION
and the original fit formula.
